# CO-Aurora-Scripts
Multiple python scripts to automate the process of updating AIRACs and procedures (SIDs/STARs/APPs/...) using IAB and optimized but not restricted to the IVAO's Colombian Division Sectorfile.

Initially there are multiple .py scripts that in the future the idea is to get them under only one script.

A folder named NAVDATA has to be created in the scripts location.
